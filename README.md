# Merkel Cell Carcinoma: Explainable Machine Learning Project

This repository contains code and analysis for building an explainable machine learning model to predict Merkel Cell Carcinoma and enhance clinical trust.

---

## 📄 Project Description

Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive skin cancer. This project focuses on developing an interpretable machine learning model to help clinicians with early diagnosis and improve trust in AI-based predictions. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to explain model decisions and highlight important features influencing predictions.
